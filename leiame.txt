How to install and run on your local system

    
    composer install
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    Add your database config in the .env file (you can check my articles on how to achieve that)
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve (if the server opens up, http://127.0.0.1:8000, then we are good to go) 
    ./composer upgrade
    npm install
    ./composer  require laravel/ui
    php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
    npm install
    npm run dev

    npm i inputmask -D
    npm run dev

    composer require laravelcollective/html
    
    composer require laracasts/flash
    
    composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
    
    php artisan vendor:publish
